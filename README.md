# Click Bot

The new Click Bot for [Click Converse](http://clickwiki.net/wiki/Click_Converse), the Official [Clickteam](https://www.clickteam.com/) [Discord](https://discord.gg) server. 

ClickBot uses [Luvit](https://luvit.io/) and the [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia) library in order to function. 

Made by [@Uppernate](https://github.com/Uppernate) ([BartekB](https://community.clickteam.com/members/14816-BartekB)), with help from [@lumezian](https://github.com/lumezian) (Lumez, [colm44](https://community.clickteam.com/members/18843-colm44)) and [@advaith1](https://github.com/advaith1) ([advaith](https://community.clickteam.com/members/21114-advaith)).

It is planned to make this bot quite extensive, mostly for moderation purposes.
